# Git and GitHub Practice Repository

## Overview

This repository is created for practicing Git and GitHub commands and repository management. It serves as a sandbox for experimenting with version control workflows, collaborating with others, and understanding various features of Git and GitHub.

## Purpose

The primary purpose of this repository is to gain hands-on experience with:

- Basic Git commands (e.g., `git init`, `git add`, `git commit`, `git push`)
- Advanced Git commands (e.g., `git rebase`, `git cherry-pick`, `git stash`)
- Branching and merging strategies (e.g., feature branching, Git flow)
- Pull requests and code reviews
- Collaborative development workflows (e.g., forking, upstream repositories)
- GitHub features such as issues, projects, wikis, and actions

## Features

- **Version Control Practice:** Experiment with creating, branching, merging, and managing versions of code.
- **Collaboration:** Invite collaborators to work on projects together and practice collaborating on code changes.
- **GitHub Features Exploration:** Explore and utilize GitHub's additional features like issues for bug tracking, projects for task management, wikis for documentation, and actions for automating workflows.
